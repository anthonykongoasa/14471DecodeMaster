README

This repository contains FTC Team 14471’s TeleOp and Autonomous robot code for the FTC Decode Season (2025-2026) It uses the Road Runner quickstart project as a base (with files reorganized and modified to fit our robot) with several additions including a Baserobot class which greatly efficencizes teleop and auto code.
